# Explicit Requirements
- Provide a map screen (using any map SDK of your choosing)
- Allow custom locations to be added from the map screen
- The user should be able to provide names for these locations
- Show pins for both default and custom locations on the map
- Provide a screen listing all locations, sorted by distance
- When locations are selected on either the map or list screen, show a detail screen
- In the detail screen, allow the user to enter notes about the location
- All information entered by the user must be persisted between app launches

# Getting Started
1. Clone the repo
$ git clone git@github.com:maquadir/CochleariOS.git (or) Download source code and unzip the downloaded folder and open project in Xcode.

2. Navigate to the project folder
$ cd CochleariOS

3. Open Cochlearn.xcodeproj from the folder.

4. Build the project (⌘+B) and check for any errors.

5. Run the app (⌘+R).and test it.

# Building
1. App uses CocoaPods for managing the installation of third-party libraries. If you don't already have it installed, here's how you can do so:

   ### Using Google maps
        pod 'GoogleMaps'
   
   ### Using Google places   
        pod 'GooglePlaces'
   
2. Run pod install in project's root directory.

### Using the pre-compiled libraries
1. Open CochleariOS.xcworkspace in the latest public version of Xcode.
2. Build the project.

# Running the tests
- Run using an emulator or usb device after opening the project in Xcode

### Application start
On application start, it will display a map view with 2 buttons. The maps screen open asking for permission to access your current location. The user can see landmarks posted by other users, and search them. However, they will not be able to find their own location, but will be able to create any new landmarks on the map.A blue dot indicating the current location is displayed on location permission access.

### Adding a landmark with a title
When the application is started and location permission is approved, then the user is automatically pointed to its current location. The user can create landmark at their current location and any other location on the map. The primary way to create a new landmark is to click any location on the map which will display a dialog to insert a title on that location.After entering a title and clicking ok a landmark with a title is created for that user which can be looked up by clicking on the marker. On clicking cancel, the marker is not added to the map. The marker is represented by a red location icon.

### Adding details to a landmark
After a landmark is crated, the user can add specific notes by clicking on the existing landmark which displays a detail screen to add a note. On clicking save some details about the landmark gets saved in the database. On clicking cancel, no details are created.
